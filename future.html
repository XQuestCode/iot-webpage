                    <p style="color:white">The Internet of Things is a fast growing industry that
                        can be divided into several categories: consumer,
                        commercial, and industrial. <span style="font-size:

                        take a look at four aspects directly related to the

                    <p style="color:white">IoT companies are helping pave the way for a future with
                        minimized waste, energy efficiency and greater personal
                        autonomy. However, to be sustainable, a connected device
                        system must be feedback rich and responsive, and actions
                        must be connected through data. Some of the pathways to
                        achieving a responsive and actionable system include:</p>
                    <ul style="color:white" ><li ><strong >Extending the use cycle</strong> with
                            predictive maintenance, instead of the “break-fix”
                            model of manufacturing.</li><li><strong>Increasing
                                utilization </strong>and reducing unplanned
                            downtime.</li><li><strong>Looping the asset</strong>
                            to reuse, remanufacture, or recycle, thanks to

                            history.</li></ul>



                    <p style="color:white">An interesting case study is Michelin, who are <a
                            href="https://business.michelinman.com/mining-quarries"
                            target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adding
                            sensors</a> to tires to better understand wear over
                        time. This data is useful for customers to know when to
                        rotate or replace tires which saves them money and
                        improves safety. But this also means Michelin can shift
                        their business model to leasing tires instead of selling
                        them. Sensor data will tell the company how to maintain
                        the tires, so Michelin has a new commercial interest in
                        making tires last as long as possible as the company now
                        owns them.</p>



                    <h3 style="color:rgb(233, 255, 106)">2. IoT Security Improvements</h3>



                    <p style="color:white">A challenge for businesses making a pivot to IoT is that
                        it not only requires a full stack team of mechanical,
                        electrical, and firmware engineers for the hardware, but
                        also a software team to design and manage the cloud
                        infrastructure and app developers so your users can
                        understand the data and make their own decisions.</p>
                    <p style="color:white">Though the technology has been around for years, IoT is
                        still relatively in its infancy when it comes to
                        regulation and security. Many companies want to be the
                        first to market with their product, so security often
                        takes a backseat. It’s easy for both consumers and
                        businesses to think, “Why would anyone hack my Wi-Fi
                        coffee machine?” You may not worry about the coffee
                        machine, but if your connected car or baby monitor were
                        compromised, then this faulty security can have some
                        very real consequences.</p>



                    <p style="color:white">As more devices are released into the public, the attack
                        surface is growing. Surveys show that improving security
                        is more important than cost to purchase. For the future
                        of IoT, customers need to be in control of their data,
                        and companies need to improve trust by addressing the
                        public’s privacy and security concerns.</p>



                    <h3 style="color:rgb(239, 253, 93)">3. Artificial Intelligence and IoT</h3>



                    <p style="color:white">IoT delivers data, but it’s only valuable if the data is
                        actionable. AI helps provide context and creativity to
                        drive intelligent actions from the collected data. There
                        are 3 levels of utility of AI and IoT:</p>


                    
                    <ol style="color:white"><li><strong>Basic</strong>: A prediction to forecast and
                            mitigate risky events, using real-time data to
                            determine when machinery and equipment will break
                            down.</li><li><strong>Middle</strong>: A power of
                            prescription (vehicles can course-correct when car
                            veers from center of the lane, railway track sensors
                            can warn against track failures).</li><li><strong>Advanced</strong>:
                            Deliver adaptive or autonomous response (blood
                            glucose sensors can alter insulin delivery levels in
                            response to changing patient needs).</li></ol>



                    <p style="color:white">AI can offer risk management, such as detecting
                        fraudulent behavior in ATMs, predicting driver insurance
                        premiums based on driving patterns, or predictive
                        maintenance – reducing maintenance time, increasing
                        equipment uptime, and improving overall maintenance
                        costs.</p>



                    <h3 style="color:rgb(236, 255, 95)">4. IoT Networks Decentralized</h3>



                    <p style="color:white">More is being put on cloud service providers like AWS and
                        Azure, presenting a bottleneck single-point-of-failure
                        for connected systems. Unfortunately, this also presents
                        them as a growing target for attacks as they gain more
                        market share, and thus an increase in potential attack
                        surface.</p>

                        shared among the nodes of a network instead of a central
                        server; however, the encryption and verification of
                        blockchain transactions are computationally intensive,
                        and IoT devices typically have limited computing power.</p>
                    <p style="color:white">As more devices become IoT connected, they will put a
                        strain on cloud infrastructure and maintenance costs. We
                        will need to reduce reliance on cloud-based platforms to
                        analyze data and make data-driven decisions faster.
                        Companies and businesses will need to weigh the options
                        of bringing data to the cloud (if it is actually needed)
                        or processing at the edge.</p>

                        previously have thought possible. We will soon see
                        massive shifts in how our data is regulated and can
                        expect better security legislation. IoT will continue to
                        form the backbone of many technologies that will change
                        the way we all live. This is certainly an exciting
                        industry to be in right now!</p>
