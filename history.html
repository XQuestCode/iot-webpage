        <h2 style="color:rgb(238, 255, 57)">A Brief History of IoT Technologies</h2>
        <p style="color:white">The concept of adding sensors and intelligence to physical objects was first discussed in the 1980s, when some university students decided to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/industries/little-known-story-first-iot-device/">modify a Coca-Cola vending machine</a>&nbsp;to track its contents remotely. But the technology was bulky and progress was limited.</p>
        <p style="color:white">The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/kevin-ashton-describes-the-internet-of-things-180953749/#:~:text=Kevin%20Ashton%20is%20an%20innovator,and%20Discovery%2C%20out%20January%2020.">term ‘Internet of Things’ was coined in 1999</a>&nbsp;by the computer scientist Kevin Ashton. While working at Procter &amp; Gamble, Ashton proposed putting radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips on products to track them through a supply chain.</p>
        <p style="color:white">He reportedly worked the<a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/history-of-iot/">&nbsp;then-buzzword 'internet' into his proposal</a>&nbsp;to get the executives' attention. And the phrase stuck.</p>
        <p style="color:white">Over the next decade, public interest in IoT technology began to take off, as more and more connected devices came to market.</p>
        <p style="color:white">In 2000, LG announced the first smart refrigerator, in 2007 the first iPhone was launched and by 2008, the number of connected devices exceeded the number of people on the planet.</p>
        <p style="color:white">In 2009, Google started testing driverless cars and in 2011, Google's Nest smart thermostat hit the market, which allowed remote control of central heating.</p>
         

        <h3 style="color:rgb(229, 251, 86)">Everyday Examples of Use Cases</h3>
        <p style="color:white">Connected devices fall into three domains:</p>
        <ul style="color:white">
        <li><strong>consumer</strong> IoT, such as wearables,</li>
        <li><strong>enterprise</strong> IoT, which includes smart factories and precision agriculture,</li>
        <li>and <strong>public spaces</strong> IoT, such as waste management.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="color:white">Businesses use IoT to optimize their supply chains, manage inventory and improve customer experience, while smart consumer devices such as the Amazon Echo speaker, are now ubiquitous in homes due to the prevalence of low-cost and low-power sensors.</p>
        <p style="color:white">Cities have been deploying IoT technology for more than a decade – to streamline everything from water meter readings to traffic flow.</p>
        <p style="color:white">“In New York City, for example, every single building (so more than 817,000) was retrofitted with a wireless water meter, starting back in 2008, which replaced the manual system where you had to walk up to a meter read the numbers and generate bills that way,” says Jeff Merritt, the World Economic Forum’s head of IoT and Urban Transformation.</p>
        <p style="color:white">“Many cities now leverage license plate readers, traffic counters, red light cameras, radiation sensors and surveillance cameras to manage day-to-day operations.”</p>
        <p style="color:white">In medicine, the IoT can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/internet-of-bodies-covid19-recovery-governance-health-data/">help improve healthcare</a>&nbsp;through real-time remote patient monitoring, robotic surgery and devices such as smart inhalers.</p>
        <p style="color:white">In the past 12 months, the role of the IoT in the COVID-19 pandemic has been invaluable.</p>
        <p style="color:white">“IoT applications such as connected thermal cameras, contact tracing devices and health-monitoring wearables are providing critical data needed to help fight the disease, while temperature sensors and parcel tracking will help ensure that sensitive COVID-19 vaccines are distributed safely,” according to the Forum’s&nbsp;<a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_State_of_the_Connected_World_2020.pdf">State of the Connected World</a>&nbsp;report.</p>
        <p style="color:white">Beyond healthcare, IoT has helped make COVID disrupted supply chains more resilient, automated activities in warehouses and on factory floors to help promote social distancing and provided safe remote access to industrial machines.</p>
